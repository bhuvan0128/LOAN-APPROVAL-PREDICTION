# Problem Definition

Loan approval prediction poses a unique challenge due to the multifaceted nature of the factors that influence an applicant’s ability to repay a loan. Traditionally, loan officers have relied on a set of criteria—such as credit score, income level, age, and past loan repayment history—when determining the risk associated with lending money to an individual. However, this process often lacks objectivity and is subject to human bias, where subjective interpretations of the data can lead to unfair or inconsistent decisions. Additionally, the sheer volume of loan applications in large financial institutions makes it increasingly difficult for human evaluators to maintain accuracy and efficiency.


## Key Insights

- Credit History is the most significant factor in approval.

- Higher Applicant Income improves chances of approval.

- Loan Amount & Debt-to-Income Ratio influence the decision.

- Random Forest Model performed best among tested algorithms.


## Future Scope

- Improve feature engineering for better accuracy.

- Optimize model performance with hyperparameter tuning.

- Deploy the model as a web-based tool for real-world use.
